# Changes compared to the original design

In settings there is no dyslexic mode, colour blind mode or bigger buttons (accessibility settings) mode options. Instead you can change your set departure and arrival locations from the settings page. There is also no scan ticket button as that was not enough time to implement the functionality to find the airports that flights would go to.

No worded summary within forecast and no hints on what clothes to pack

We changed the holding of the pindrop to change locations and instead put this in the settings options

We dont have a 24 hour time format

The user will not be able to view mid-flight atmospheric conditions

One final feature we did not implement was the idea of warnings being presented in the forecasts however as mentioned before, due to time constraints, we were unable to work on this. With future updates, this feature could easily be implemented.

We have integrated a currency converter which was not in our initial plan

We have integrated hourly forecast alongside daily forecast
